# Capture The Flag
## Rules, Preparation and details
### 1.Preparation
##### Physical objects:
* 2 different balls, or the "flags", called F1 and F2 for team 1 и team 2
* 2 different objects, or the "bases", called B1 and B2 for team 1 and team 2, in which F1 and F2 are placed

##### People:
* a judge, called S
* 2 returners, sitting near B, called V1(near B1) and V2(near B2) *(for them it isn't required to watch the game carefully, but only listen for S's signal)*
* An even count of players, divided equally in the 2 teams, with everyone from team 1 being called a E1 and everyone from team 2 being called a E2 *(team 1 is called T1 and team 2 is called T2)*, and the more E, the better.

### 2.Placement
##### Objects:
|Object(s)|placement(s)                            |
|---------|----------------------------------------|
|B1,B2    |In the two ends of a room/yard/corridor |
|F1,F2    |B1,B2                                   |

##### Peoples:
|Person/People|placement(s)                                         |
|-------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
|S            |in a place, where they can see the whole game field  |
|V1,V2        |Б1,Б2                                                |
|E1,E2        |Begin around B1,B2, after that they can go everywhere|

### 3.The game
In the beggining T1 and T2 set a max score.
Next, E1 are in B1, and E2 are in B2. After that E1 try to get F2, and E2 to get F1.
They can't bumb/hit/hurt in any physical way each other, but if they do it they are out of the game (they can be in the next game).
EXAMPLE: 
When E1 gets F2 and brings it to B1, S gives a signal and E freeze in place. Then V1 returns F2 to B2,
then S gives a second signal, E continue to move and S counts 1 point for T1. 
\*the same applies when E2 gets F1, gets it to B2, V2 returns it.
The first team, who reaches the max score wins the game.
