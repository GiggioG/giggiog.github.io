<h3 id="the-game">3.The game</h3>
<p>In the beggining T1 and T2 set a max score. Next, E1 are in B1, and E2 are in B2. After that E1 try to get F2, and E2 to get F1. They can’t bumb/hit/hurt in any physical way each other, but if they do it they are out of the game (they can be in the next game). EXAMPLE: When E1 gets F2 and brings it to B1, S gives a signal and E freeze in place. Then V1 returns F2 to B2, then S gives a second signal, E continue to move and S counts 1 point for T1. *the same applies when E2 gets F1, gets it to B2, V2 returns it. The first team, who reaches the max score wins the game.</p>
