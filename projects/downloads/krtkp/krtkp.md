# Krtkp and Srtd
## What are Krtkp and Srtd
Krtkp is the name I gave for my Bulgarian shorthand. The English version is named Srtd. They have a shared [WSID](https://giggiog.github.io/wsid) of 16. Both the names of the systems come from the letters that remain in the shortest possible forms of "Shorthand" in both languages ("Kratkopis" in Bulgarian).
## How to read the images in these docs
Anything black is the Krtkp or Srtd that the image's trying to show. Anything red is a placeholder to show you how things should be alined. Anything grey shows you what something means (in both systems). Lightblue is just for Krtkp meaning and lightorange is just for Srtd. Green is for `"parameters" and "counts"`. 
## The similarities between the Krtkp and Srtd
### The underlying system
All the differences are pretty minor, this is why they share a documentation. All text in English is valid Srtd, all Bulgarian is valid Krtkps. These systems are just extensions of their corresponding languages. They are both structured in the following way: Symbols, resembling diacritics are placed one after another on top of letters from the corresponding languages. I will call these "diacritics" `"signs"` from now on. A letter with signs above it is called a `"stack"`. 
### Shared rules
Both of the systems share the following rules:
* You shouldn't put any signs on capital letters.
* Stacks shouldn't get too high. 
* The stacks are interpreted from bottom to top, from right to left. More detail on this rule can be found [here](#more-details-on-the-interpretation-order).
* Signs correspond to letters, not sounds, so a word should be pronounced as it would be in it's language without any signs.

### Shared signs
Both the systems share these signs, they have similar meanings in both languages:

### Krtkp specific signs
These signs are specific to the Krtkp (Bulgarian) system. The Srtd (English) system doesn't have them because they are specific to the Bulgarian language.

### Srtd specific signs
This sign is specific for English, because I think Bulgarian doesn't need a specific "H" sign. I tought it was required in English to be used onto an "S" to make it "SH", but you can use it however you want.

### More details on the interpretation order
As I mentioned above, each stack is interpreted from bottom to top, from right to left. I hope I can make that clear with this demonstration in Srtd:
