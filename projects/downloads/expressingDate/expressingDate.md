This is a script by a deleted reddit user on [r/neography](https://reddit.com/r/neography). ([WSID](https://giggiog.github.io/wsid) 108). You can find the original post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/neography/comments/10i0mdd/expressing_time).  
You express a clockhand's position by directly drawing it if it's up, down, left or right. If it's diagonal, you draw it at
45Â° and put a small line towards the correct direction.  
You should draw the hour hand smaller than the minute hand, like on a real clock. You add dots, because the minutes are 
rounded down. You add `^` for PM and `v` for AM.
