# Takavoza
## What is Takavoza
Takavoza is a writing system I created back around autumn of 2019. It was inspired by Arabic script, but at the time I was in 4th grade and didn't know anything about how the Arabic script works.
## How to read the images in these docs
Anything black is the Takavoza that the image's trying to show. Anything red is a placeholder to show you how things should be alined. Anything grey shows you what something means.
## The writing system
It is an abugida, where everythig is written on a line called Linya.  
In the rest of the docs I will be explaining the following sentence in Takavoza:

## "English"
Takavoza is a script made for the Bulgarian language, so it roughly follows [Bulgarian Phonology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulgarian_phonology). This is why the example text written above actually says `dis: egzampal sentans!`.
## Structure
The linya begins with a spiral above it and ends with a spiral below it as shown here. Takavoza is written in [Boustrophedon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boustrophedon), as will be difficult to wrap the linya back to the left side of the new line. The horizonatl flipping applies both to the letters (including the vowels), and the ending spiral. The letters are not put onto the linya, but are different ways of curving it. You can tell this by the fact that the linja doesn't run right through the `S`. Punctuation is the same as in English/Bulgarian. It is written once above the linya, and once below it, flipped vertically. You can see this in the example by the exclamation sign.
## The consonants
Takavoza has the following consonants:  
![Takavoza's consonants](https://i.imgur.com/zhiYWgk.png)  
The one labeled `Ø` is a placeholder consonant. It is used when you want to write just a vowel. The red lines show where you should place the vowel for a specific consonant.
## The vowels
These are Takavoza's vowels:

Again, one labeled `Ø` is a placeholder vowel. It is used when writing consonant clusters.
## How to write
You write the consonant, then depending on the consonant, you write the vowel either above or below it. The `e` vowel flips when it is below, so it's pointy bit should always face outwards.
## Numbers
Takavoza has a base 10 number system. The digits are written in a trapezoid with the bottom base missing and the linya forming the top base. **WHEN WRITING NUMBERS THEY ARE ADDED ONTO THE LINYA, NOT CREATED FROM CURVING IT**. This is demonstrated here:

This is the number 1234567890.
