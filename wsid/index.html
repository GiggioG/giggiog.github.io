        <h1 class="primary-text">What is WSID</h1>
        <p class="content-paragraph">
            WSID is a system for knowing in what writing system I have quickly written something. <br> I am a person that frequently looks around in r/neography and similar places and likes <br> to try the scripts that people create, but I also like knowing
            what I wrote in some<br> obscure script 2 months ago. That's why I created WSID. Every time before I try a new script,<br> I add a new entry to the google sheet with the name of the script, its ID and a link to<br> where it's documented. I
            usually try these scripts on paper, so somewhere around the text<br> I wrote with the script, I draw the following symbol, followed by the WSID of the script I'm<br> trying. Like in this example, sitelen sitelen (WSID 8):

        <img src="https://i.imgur.com/phIBx76.jpg" alt="WSID symbol example for WSID 8" style="width:10%">
        <p class="content-paragraph">
            The symbol has two parts, with the<br> first one being a ligature of W(rotated 90Â° anti-clockwise) and an S. The little line in<br> the bottom of the WS part is optional. The second part is a ligature of a lowercase i<br> and a lowercase d.
            For now only I can add writing systems to WSID, because I made it for<br> myself, but I encourage everyone to create a similar system for themselves. If you do,<br> then PLEASE don't use my symbol, because that will create lots of confusion.
            If enough<br> people create their own systems for documenting scripts, then we might need WSIDID - a system<br> for documenting WSID systems, but that's far off into the future for now...
